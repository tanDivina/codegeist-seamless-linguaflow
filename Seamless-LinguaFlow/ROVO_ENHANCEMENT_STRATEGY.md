      I can help analyze terminology consistency! Upload your text to any Jira issue...

USER: "What's the project status for PRJ-123?"  
ROVO: 📊 **Project Status for PRJ-123**
      Current stage: Review | Translator: John | Due: Friday...

USER: "Export this as XLIFF"
ROVO: 💾 **Professional File Export**
      I can generate enterprise deliverables! Visit the Jira issue to access export options...
```

### **2. Omnichannel Integration** 🔄
**Rovo ↔ Jira Panel Synchronization:**
- Start translation in Rovo chat → Continue in Jira issue panel

### **3. Intelligent Context Awareness** 🧠
**Smart Rovo Features:**
```
USER: "Translate this technical documentation"

      • Prioritizing engagement over literal accuracy
```

### **4. Enterprise Workflow Integration** 👥
